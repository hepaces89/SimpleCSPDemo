<p>
This page has it's CSP header inserted via the CSPFilter1.java class. As a result the "report-uri" parameter is supported.

This page attempts to load jQuery from an external CDN.

If you go to the Web Browser Console, you can see that the CSP header prevented the external javascript from loading and threw an error

Content Security Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a resource at https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js ("default-src http://localhost:8080").
</p>

<p>
Also the report uri option is supported via the CSP header.

As configured the filter printed out the reported CSP violation that it received from the browser.
